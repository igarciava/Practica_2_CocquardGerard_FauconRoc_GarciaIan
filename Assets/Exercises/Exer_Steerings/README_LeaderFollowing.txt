The folder Resources contains two prefabs
one is a chick that uses LeaderFollowingArbitrated
the other is a chick that uses LeaderFollowingBlended

In each scene the HEN spawns four chicks

Notice that both the HEAN and the spawned chicks are tagged REPULSIVE
(Otherwise LinearRepulsion will not work properly)
